# CeloHT Education

CeloHT Education is the official open education framework of CeloHT. It trains individuals and communities to **use Celo, cUSD, and Valora as practical financial tools**, not speculative assets.

## Core Philosophy
Education → Usage → Community Impact

## The 3 Pillars

### 1. Celo
The blockchain infrastructure enabling fast, low-cost, mobile-first finance.

### 2. cUSD
Stable digital money used as the base unit of learning, saving, sending, and community finance.

### 3. Valora
The default wallet and learning interface for all users.

No alternative chains. No wallet confusion. No token speculation.
